Welcome to **think.ai**, a research blog dedicated to exploring quantum mechanics, quantum field theory, and attosecond physics.

## What You'll Find Here

This blog serves as a platform to share:

- **Research insights** from ongoing studies in quantum physics
- **Technical notes** on computational methods and simulations
- **Theory discussions** on QFT, quantum mechanics, and mathematical physics
- **Attosecond physics** explorations and ultrafast dynamics

## Current Research Focus

My current research interests include:

1. **Hydrogen atom dynamics** under attosecond pulse interactions
2. **Quantum mechanical systems** in confined geometries
3. **Amplituhedron geometry** applications in quantum mechanics
4. **Computational physics** simulations using Python and MATLAB

## Stay Connected

Feel free to explore the posts and reach out via GitHub if you're interested in collaboration or have questions about the research.

Let's explore the quantum frontier together!
